<h2 id="clone-a-repository">Clone a repository</h2>
<p>Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don&#39;t yet have SourceTree, <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">download and install first</a>. If you prefer to clone from the command line, see <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ">Clone a repository</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You’ll see the clone button under the <strong>Source</strong> heading. Click that button.</li>
<li>Now click <strong>Check out in SourceTree</strong>. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.</li>
<li>When you see the <strong>Clone New</strong> dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click <strong>Clone</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you&#39;re more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg">push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree</a>, or you can <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ">add, commit,</a> and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ">push from the command line</a>.</p>
